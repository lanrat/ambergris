Inside the Belly of a Whale


For those of you in the know, Ambergris is defined as:

> a wax-like substance that originates as a secretion in the intestines
of the sperm whale, found floating in tropical seas and used in
perfume manufacture.


However that is not what this repository is about (sorry to disappoint). Instead I show what happens when building an image on Docker that contains a reverse shell in the `Dockerfile`.
